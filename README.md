# Summary
This is a wip website for presenting projects a resume, and practicing front end dev

# Goals
1. Formalize a basic style for the website
2. Set up all the basic pages with this style
3. Add more content (projects, resources, etc)
4. Add easter eggs to the website (possibly linux/unix command line within?)
